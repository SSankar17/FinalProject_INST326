Final Codebook


In our repository, we have 4 files: .gitignore, PlayerClass.py, README.md, and board_game_spaces.txt.
*  .gitignore was to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. 
* PlayerClass.py is our final code script containing all the functions necessary as well as the main function in which the game runs. The game can be called from this file.
* README.md are the markdown files that describe a directory. 
* Board_games_spaces.txt is the text file our code is meant to read to read the board for our game and keep track of where the players are in respect to the board.
